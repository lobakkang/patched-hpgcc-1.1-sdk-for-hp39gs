\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}\#define WIN\_\-ALPHA\_\-CHANGED~4}\label{winkeys_8h_a3}


Event number for changes in the alpha key's state. 

An alpha changed event occurs whenever the state of the alpha key is changed. This is a high-level event involving the interpretation of keys. It only operates for key events that were not consumed by handlers for {\bf WIN\_\-KEY\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a0})} and {\bf WIN\_\-KEY\_\-RELEASED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a1})}.

The event data field for this event type is one of the key state constants, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-OFF}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a6})}, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-ON}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a7})}, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-LOCK}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a8})}, or {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a9})}.

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}\#define WIN\_\-KEY\_\-PRESSED~1}\label{winkeys_8h_a0}


Event number for key pressed events. 

A key pressed event occurs whenever the user presses any key on the keyboard.

The event data field for this event type is an {\tt int} containing the key code for the key that was pressed. The key code is a constant defined in {\tt hpkeyb49.h} and beginning with the {\tt KB\_\-} prefix.

\begin{Desc}
\item[Warning:]Consuming events of this type can interfere with the operation of the shift keys. \end{Desc}

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}\#define WIN\_\-KEY\_\-RELEASED~2}\label{winkeys_8h_a1}


Event number for key released events. 

A key released event occurs whenever the user releases any key on the keyboard.

The event data field for this event type is an {\tt int} containing the key code for the key that was pressed. The key code is a constant defined in {\tt hpkeyb49.h} and beginning with the {\tt KB\_\-} prefix.

\begin{Desc}
\item[Warning:]Consuming events of this type can interfere with the operation of the shift keys. \end{Desc}

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}\#define WIN\_\-KEY\_\-TYPED~3}\label{winkeys_8h_a2}


Event number for key typed events. 

A key typed event occurs whenever a keypress should be handled at the application level. This is a higher-level event than key pressed, and more suitable for application tasks. Key typed events are generated for key presses that were not consumed by a {\bf WIN\_\-KEY\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a0})} handler, and which are not shift keys. Unlike {\bf WIN\_\-KEY\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a0})}, the event field for this event contains semantic information like the logical shift key state and equivalent ASCII character.

This event is not generated for shift keys (left shift, right shift, and alpha). To detect actions on these keys, see the {\bf WIN\_\-ALPHA\_\-CHANGED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a3})}, {\bf WIN\_\-LSHIFT\_\-CHANGED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a4})}, and {\bf WIN\_\-RSHIFT\_\-CHANGED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a5})} events.

The event data field for this event type is a pointer to {\bf win\_\-keytyped\_\-t}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{structwin__keytyped__t})}, which contains a variety of information about the event.

\item[See also:]{\bf win\_\-keytyped\_\-t}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{structwin__keytyped__t})} \end{Desc}

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}\#define WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-ON~1}\label{winkeys_8h_a7}


Constant for a shift key that is active. 

\begin{Desc}
\item[Note:]In most cases, applications should test for {\tt shift} {\tt $>$} {\tt 0} rather that comparing the shift state against this constant. Other non-zero values, such as locked, are generally equivalent. \end{Desc}

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}\#define WIN\_\-LSHIFT\_\-CHANGED~5}\label{winkeys_8h_a4}


Event number for changes in the left shift key's state. 

A left shift changed event occurs whenever the state of the left shift key is changed. This is a high-level event involving the interpretation of keys. It only operates for key events that were not consumed by handlers for {\bf WIN\_\-KEY\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a0})} and {\bf WIN\_\-KEY\_\-RELEASED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a1})}.

The event data field for this event type is one of the key state constants, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-OFF}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a6})}, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-ON}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a7})}, or {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a9})}. (The semantics for left shift dictate that it can never be locked.)

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}\#define WIN\_\-RSHIFT\_\-CHANGED~6}\label{winkeys_8h_a5}


Event number for changes in the right shift key's state. 

A right shift changed event occurs whenever the state of the right shift key is changed. This is a high-level event involving the interpretation of keys. It only operates for key events that were not consumed by handlers for {\bf WIN\_\-KEY\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a0})} and {\bf WIN\_\-KEY\_\-RELEASED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a1})}.

The event data field for this event type is one of the key state constants, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-OFF}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a6})}, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-ON}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a7})}, or {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a9})}. (The semantics for right shift dictate that it can never be locked.)
