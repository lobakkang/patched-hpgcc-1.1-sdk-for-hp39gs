The HPGCC window system will provides a small collection of common graphical user interface building blocks, from which interactive applications can be built in HPGCC.

The main features of the window system include:

\begin{itemize}
\item A general-purpose event queue to deliver both standard and custom events to all interested parties. \item A simple widget model allowing developers to write re-usable graphical widgets. \item An implementation of the standard HP calculator keyboard operation, including correct operation of shift and alpha keys. \item A soft menu widget to associate operations with function keys. \end{itemize}
