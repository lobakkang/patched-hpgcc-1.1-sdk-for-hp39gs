\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}unsigned {\bf win\_\-keytyped\_\-t::alpha}}\label{structwin__keytyped__t_o4}


State of the right shift key. 

This field represents the state of the alpha key when this key was typed. It is set to one of {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-ON}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a7})}, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-OFF}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a6})}, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-LOCK}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a8})}, or {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a9})}.

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}char {\bf win\_\-keytyped\_\-t::ascii}}\label{structwin__keytyped__t_o1}


The ASCII equivalent of the key that was typed. 

If the key maps to an ASCII character, this field provides the ASCII code of the character represented by this key. If the key does not have an equivalent ASCII character, this field is set to NUL ({\tt '} ').

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}unsigned {\bf win\_\-keytyped\_\-t::keycode}}\label{structwin__keytyped__t_o0}


The keycode for the key that was typed. 

This code will match one of the key code constants defined in {\tt hpheyb49.h} of the form {\tt KB\_\-XXX}.

State of the left shift key. 

This field represents the state of the left shift key when this key was typed. It is set to one of {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-ON}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a7})}, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-OFF}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a6})}, or {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a9})}.

State of the right shift key. 

This field represents the state of the right shift key when this key was typed. It is set to one of {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-ON}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a7})}, {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-OFF}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a6})}, or {\bf WIN\_\-KEYSTATE\_\-PRESSED}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{winkeys_8h_a9})}.
