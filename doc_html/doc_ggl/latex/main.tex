\section{Overview}\label{main_overview}
GGL (the Gray Graphics Library) provides extended functions for 16-color grayscale graphics on the HP49G+ (and possible HP39G+ and HP48g\-II) calculators. It complements the abilities of HPG by providing faster and more specialized routines for the 16-color grayscale mode. GGL may be used independently of HPG, or seamlessly alongside it.

The main features of the GGL library are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Optimizations for 16-color grayscale drawing\item Fast bitblt routine\item Masked sprites\item Antialiased lines \end{itemize}
