# Patched HPGCC 1.1 SDK for HP 39gs aplet development

## How to use
1. source the ```pls_source_me.sh``` in the SDK directory
2. If the ```hp2aplet``` is not working, rebuild it by run ```build.sh``` in ```sources/HP39-Aplet/hp2aplet/```
3. cd into the ```template```
4. run Makefile to ensure the toolchain is working.
